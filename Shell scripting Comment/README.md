# Linux shell script Comment

Comment are essential in programming, serving as notes to the programmer and anyone else who might read the code.

There are 2 types of comment.
- single line commen
- Multiple line comment

1. Single line comment: Single line comment in bash is denoted by the symbol #, and where used simply means that statement should be not executed.  for example
![single line comment](./img/10.1.comment.png)

2. Multiple line comment: These are multiple hash, added to several lines of code so they are not executed. see below
![multiple line comment](./img/10.2.comment.png)

Best practices for commenting are highlighted below

- Clarity: Been clear and concise
- Maintainability: Keep comment updatedd always.
- Usefulness: Comment when it needed, making it useful
- Avoid over commenting: limit commenting and dont comment on every line of code.

That marks the end of the project.
